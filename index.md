# AI Adoption Strategies Overview

## Strategic Approach to AI Implementation

To make the most of their investment in AI, companies should define a clear strategy for deploying it. Based on their objectives for adopting AI as well as the level of risk of using AI, managers can come up with suitable AI adoption strategies.

## AI Adoption Strategy Options

| Strategy | Description | Managerial Strategy | Situational Risk |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **1. Low-hanging Fruits** | Start with areas already suited for AI to achieve quick wins and build momentum (e.g., marketing first, then ops, finance, HR). | Differentiation | Low |
| **2. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** | Use robotic automation to streamline workflows. Requires investment but reduces costs and improves efficiency. | Cost reduction | Low |
| **3. Crawling** | Begin with small, low-risk AI use cases before moving to more complex implementations. | Differentiation | High |
| **4. Guinea pigs** | Let smaller partners experiment with AI. If successful, consider alliances or acquisitions. | Cost reduction | High |
| **5. Partnership** | Partner with AI-advanced firms to access expertise and data and build internal capabilities over time. | Cost reduction | High |
